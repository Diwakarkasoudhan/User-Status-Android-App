# User-Status-Android-App

		User Status (Online or Offline)
As I have mention in my interview that I have little knowledge of firebase. So, I have created the app as per my task given by you (sir, Saurabh Jadhav).
About The App: This app has two section. 
Section 1: for the user where once the user sign in it check the internet connection, if the phone is connected is connected to internet it will get its user date & time and shows it to the admin once the admin log in.
Section 2: for the admin where once the admin sign in it give the user (client or employee) status online or offline. In case the user is offline it shows the last date in which the user was active.

For Admin : 
Username : admin
Password : 123

For client : 
Username : user
Password : 123
